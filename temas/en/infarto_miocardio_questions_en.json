    {
      "question": "What is the main cause of Type 1 AMI?",
      "options": [
        "Atherosclerotic plaque rupture",
        "severe hypoperfusion",
        "Ion pump failure",
        "High tangential stress"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Type 1 Acute Myocardial Infarction, which constitutes 90% of cases, is caused by an acute thrombotic event, which is almost always the direct result of the rupture or erosion of a pre-existing vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, exposing its lipid core to the blood."
    },
    {
      "question": "What defines vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque?",
      "options": [
        "Large lipid core",
        "Small lipid core",
        "thick fibrous layer",
        "Low inflammation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Vulnerable plaques, which are the precursors of AMI, are characterized by having a very large and soft lipid core, together with a thin fibrous cap. This combination makes them prone to rupture with hemodynamic stress, initiating thrombosis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the terminal cellular event of AMI?",
      "options": [
        "Diastolic dysfunction",
        "Anaerobic glycolysis",
        "Ischemic necrosis",
        "myocardial akinetism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The end result of abrupt and prolonged interruption of coronary blood flow is ischemic necrosis, which is the irreversible cell death of a part of the heart muscle (cardiomyocytes) due to critical lack of oxygen and nutrients."
    },
    {
      "question": "What substance breaks down the fibrous layer of plaque?",
      "options": [
        "Nitric Oxide",
        "Troponins",
        "Matrix metalloproteinases",
        "Tissue Factor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Macrophages, inflammatory cells present in the atherosclerotic plaque, release enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), which degrade collagen and elastin, weakening the fibrous layer and increasing the risk of its rupture."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens first after coronary occlusion?",
      "options": [
        "Troponin release",
        "Scar formation",
        "Irreversible ischemia",
        "Shrinkage loss"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Following occlusion, loss of contractile (akinetic) function occurs within minutes due to ATP depletion and lactic acidosis generated by anaerobic glycolysis. Irreversible damage and troponin release take 20 to 40 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What area initiates myocardial necrosis first?",
      "options": [
        "Subepicardium",
        "External epicardium",
        "Subendocardium",
        "middle myocardium"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Ischemic necrosis begins in the subendocardium, the innermost layer of the myocardium, since it is the area with the worst blood perfusion and, therefore, is the most vulnerable and susceptible to rapid oxygen depletion under ischemic conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What cardiac protein confirms necrosis?",
      "options": [
        "Fibrinogen",
        "Troponins",
        "myoglobin",
        "Lactate dehydrogenase"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The release of intracellular enzymes and cardiac proteins into the circulation, specifically Troponins, is the marker of cellular damage that confirms that irreversible myocardial necrosis has occurred due to prolonged ischemia."
    },
    {
      "question": "What factor initiates the coagulation cascade?",
      "options": [
        "Thrombin",
        "Tissue Factor",
        "ADP",
        "Thromboxan A_2"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Once the plaque ruptures, the lipid core contents, which are highly thrombogenic, expose Tissue Factor to the blood. This factor is the main initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, which leads to the massive formation of thrombin and fibrin."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does necrosis of 40% of the left ventricle lead to?",
      "options": [
        "Cardiogenic Shock",
        "Ventricular remodeling",
        "atrial fibrillation",
        "Diastolic dysfunction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Extensive necrosis of the myocardium, particularly when it affects more than 40% of the left ventricle, drastically reduces the pumping capacity of the heart, triggering Cardiogenic Shock, a serious complication of AMI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main cause of sudden death after AMI?",
      "options": [
        "Heart failure",
        "Arrhythmias",
        "Atherosclerosis",
        "cardiogenic shock"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ischemia and necrosis create areas of different electrical conduction in the myocardium. This heterogeneity facilitates the appearance of reentry phenomena, which can lead to malignant ventricular arrhythmias, with Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) being the main cause of sudden post-infarction death."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the classic symptom of AMI?",
      "options": [
        "mild abdominal pain",
        "Tingling in legs",
        "Acute pulsating headache",
        "Retrosternal oppressive pain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The classic symptom of Acute Myocardial Infarction is **chest pain** (angina) of **oppressive** type, which is located behind the sternum (retrosternal) and which often radiates to the jaw or left arm, differentiating from stable angina because it is not relieved with rest or nitrates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does classic chest pain last?",
      "options": [
        "less than ten minutes",
        "Approximately fifteen minutes",
        "More than twenty minutes",
        "Just a few seconds"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Ischemic chest pain associated with AMI is characterized by being persistent, generally lasting **greater than twenty minutes**, since coronary occlusion is causing sustained necrosis of the myocardial tissue, which requires immediate medical intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "What sign is typical in a STEMI?",
      "options": [
        "Persistent ST elevation",
        "Inverted T wave",
        "ST depression",
        "totally normal ECG"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The diagnosis of ST-segment elevation AMI (STEMI) is established on the electrocardiogram (ECG) by **persistent ST-segment elevation** or a new left bundle branch block, indicating total occlusion and the need for urgent reperfusion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'gold standard' diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Troponin measurement",
        "Potassium concentration",
        "Creatinine levels",
        "Sedimentation rate"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "**Troponins** (I or T) are the cardiac biomarker considered the 'gold standard' to confirm myocardial damage in AMI, since they are regulatory proteins that are released into the blood circulation exclusively when cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) undergo necrosis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which risk group presents atypical symptoms?",
      "options": [
        "Hypertensive patients",
        "Diabetic patients",
        "young men",
        "High performance athletes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "**Diabetic patients**, along with the elderly and women, are considered critical risk groups because they may present atypical symptoms (such as dyspnea or weakness) or be completely asymptomatic ('silent'), due to neuropathy that can alter the perception of classic pain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What therapy is absolute priority in STEMI?",
      "options": [
        "Administer beta blockers",
        "Perform a control ECG",
        "Give diuretic treatment",
        "Establish reperfusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "**Reperfusion** is the absolute therapeutic priority, especially in STEMI, as the goal is to restore coronary blood flow as quickly as possible, a concept known as 'time is muscle', to limit the extent of necrotic damage to the heart."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does PCI involve in acute management?",
      "options": [
        "Oral drug therapy",
        "bypass surgery",
        "Catheterization and stenting",
        "Administration of fibrinolytics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is the preferred method of reperfusion and consists of **cardiac catheterization** in which a balloon is used to open the occluded artery and a **stent** is placed to keep it patent, restoring blood flow to the myocardium."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main cause of early death?",
      "options": [
        "Kidney failure",
        "stroke",
        "tendon rupture",
        "Ventricular Fibrillation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Electrical complications, specifically Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), are the main cause of death in the first hours after an AMI, being a serious arrhythmia that prevents effective blood pumping and requires immediate defibrillation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which drug is not part of MONA?",
      "options": [
        "Aspirin (Antiplatelet)",
        "Nitrates (Vasodilator)",
        "Morphine (Analgesic)",
        "Statin (Long term)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Although crucial for long-term management and secondary prevention, **Statins** are not part of the initial acute management known by the MONA mnemonic (Morphine, Oxygen, Nitrates and Aspirin), which focuses on symptomatic relief and immediate antiplatelet aggregation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What action prevents recurrence in the long term?",
      "options": [
        "Control of risk factors",
        "Stop taking medication",
        "Reduce sleep hours",
        "Increase sodium consumption"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The key to secondary prevention and avoiding long-term AMI recurrences is **strict control of modifiable risk factors**, including stopping smoking, keeping blood pressure and blood glucose under control, and participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program."
