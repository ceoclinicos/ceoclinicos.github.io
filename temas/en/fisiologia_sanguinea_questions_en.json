      "question": "What is the name of the fluid squeezed out after the clot retraction?",
      "options": [
        "Interstitial fluid",
        "Plasma",
        "whole blood",
        "Serum"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The process of clot contraction expels a fluid known as serum. This fluid differs from plasma because it has lost fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors, meaning that the serum can no longer clot."
    },
    {
      "question": "What cells are necessary for proper clot retraction?",
      "options": [
        "platelets",
        "Lymphocytes",
        "Erythrocytes",
        "Leukocytes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Platelets are essential for the clot to contract efficiently. They release the fibrin-stabilizing factor and activate its contractile proteins (myosin, actin and thrombostenin) that compress the fibrin network into a smaller mass."

    {
      "question": "What does the extrinsic coagulation pathway begin with?",
      "options": [
        "Tissue trauma",
        "Contact with collagen",
        "Factor XII Activation",
        "Heparin release"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The extrinsic pathway is initiated mainly by trauma to the vascular wall or adjacent extravascular tissues. This trauma leads to the release of tissue factor, which begins the cascade of reactions to form the prothrombin activator."

      "question": "Hemophilia A is caused by deficiency of which factor?",
      "options": [
        "Factor VIII",
        "Factor IX",
        "Factor VII",
        "X Factor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hemophilia A, also known as classical hemophilia, is the most common form of this bleeding disease and is caused by a deficiency or abnormality in Factor VIII. It is an X-linked hereditary disease that predominantly affects men."

      "question": "What is a freely flowing clot in the blood called?",
      "options": [
        "Thrombus",
        "Aneurysm",
        "Plunger",
        "Hematoma"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "A clot that forms abnormally in a vessel is called a thrombus, but once this clot breaks off and begins to travel freely in the bloodstream, it is called an embolus. Emboli can plug distant vessels such as those in the brain or lungs."

    {
      "question": "What substance combines with heparin to be an anticoagulant?",
      "options": [
        "Antithrombin III",
        "Fibrinogen",
        "Prothrombin",
        "tissue factor"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Heparin, by itself, has few anticoagulant properties. However, when combined with Antithrombin III, it increases the latter's effectiveness in eliminating thrombin and other activated coagulation factors, acting as a powerful pharmacological anticoagulant."

    {
      "question": "What is the normal INR range in a healthy person?",
      "options": [
        "0.5 to 0.9",
        "0.9 to 1.3",
        "1.5 to 2.5",
        "3.0 to 4.0"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was created to standardize prothrombin time measurements. A normal INR value in a healthy individual is in the range of 0.9 to 1.3, indicating a low risk of bleeding or abnormal clotting."
