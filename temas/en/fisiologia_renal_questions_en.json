        "potassium ions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Glomerular capillaries are relatively impermeable to large molecules. Therefore, glomerular filtrate is a solution that essentially lacks plasma proteins and cellular elements, such as erythrocytes, unlike blood plasma."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is essential, since its high concentrations increase the permeability of the spinal collecting duct to water. This facilitates its reabsorption in the medullary interstitium, a key process for the formation of concentrated urine and water conservation."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Angiotensin II and aldosterone are two essential hormones that act on the renal tubules to modulate sodium reabsorption. High concentrations of these hormones are stimulated by low sodium intake, promoting sodium retention and preventing urinary losses."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Water-hungry reabsorption in the medullary collecting duct, promoted by antidiuretic hormone, is the primary mechanism that dramatically reduces urine volume.

        "40ml/min",
        "70ml/min"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "In normal kidneys, the clearance capacity of urea is limited, with its typical functional value being only 70 ml/min for the elimination of this waste substance."

        "225-300ml/min"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Most artificial kidneys have high efficiency, being able to remove urea from plasma with an intensity ranging between 100 ml/min and 225 ml/min, exceeding normal clearance."

    {
      "question": "How often is the artificial kidney used?",
      "options": [

        "three times a week",
        "twice a month",
        "once a week"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Although the artificial kidney is very efficient in the short term, its clinical use is limited to a few hours daily, typically three times a week, which restricts overall clearance."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The artificial kidney, although vital for waste removal, cannot carry out the endocrine functions or other complex metabolic regulations that are unique to the biological kidney and its living tissue."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The second line of defense of acid-base balance is the control exerted by the lungs by being able to quickly adjust the concentration of carbon dioxide in the extracellular fluid."

      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Carbon dioxide produced by cellular metabolism first diffuses into the interstitial fluids, and is then taken up by the blood to be transported to the lungs."

        "reverse osmosis",
        "simple diffusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "As carbon dioxide is removed through pulmonary ventilation, the concentration of hydrogen ions is reduced in the extracellular fluid due to the chemical principle of mass action."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In hemodialysis, increasing the flow of blood, dialyzer fluid, or both, optimizes the diffusion of solutes across the membrane by reducing the dissipation of the concentration gradient."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "After carbon dioxide diffuses from the cells into the interstitial fluids, it is collected and transported through the circulatory system by the blood to the lungs for subsequent exhalation."
