        "Normal bladder sound"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Dullness when striking the affected area is a crucial physical sign, since the sound does not resonate over lung tissue that is consolidated, that is, filled with fluid or inflammatory exudate."

    {
      "question": "What does increased tactile thrill indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Air presence",

        "There is pleural effusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The increase in tactile thrill, detected on palpation, occurs because sound vibrations are transmitted more efficiently through a solid or consolidated medium than through normal air in the lung."

      "options": [
        "Confusion or delirium",

        "Intense pleuritic pain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In elderly patients, the inflammatory response may be attenuated, so pneumonia often manifests in a deceptive and subtle way, with a change in mental status (confusion or delirium) being the main sign."

    {
      "question": "What process causes hypoxemia in pneumonia?",
      "options": [
        "Excessive ventilation",
        "Intrapulmonary shunt",
        "Decreased ventilation",
        "Total bronchial collapse"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Filling of the alveoli with purulent exudate (consolidation) creates an intrapulmonary short circuit (shunt effect), which means that blood passes through non-ventilated areas and leaves without oxygenation, resulting in hypoxemia."
