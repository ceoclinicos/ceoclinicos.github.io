      "question": "How much does core temperature vary in health, approximately?",
      "options": [
        "0.6 degrees Celsius",
        "13 to 54 degrees Celsius",
        "0.8 degrees Celsius",
        "1.0 degrees Celsius"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Deep tissue temperature, known as core temperature, remains remarkably stable in healthy people. This stability allows the maximum deviation to be no more than pm0.6^C under most normal conditions, demonstrating the high efficiency of the thermoregulatory system. This narrow margin is essential for the correct metabolic functioning of the body."

        "Deep core temperature",
        "Liver temperature"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skin or peripheral temperature, unlike core temperature, actively rises and falls in response to thermal variations in the environment. This fluctuation is a key mechanism that facilitates heat exchange and thermal dissipation to the atmosphere to maintain constant internal homeostasis."

        "36.5 to 37.0 degrees Celsius"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The normal core temperature range, when measured in the mouth, is generally set to average between 36.5^C and 37.0^C. It is important to remember that rectal measurements usually register a value approximately 0.6^C higher than measurements made orally. Daily variation depends on activity and time."

        "39 degrees Celsius",
        "40 degrees Celsius",
        "42 degrees Celsius"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Strenuous physical exercise dramatically increases the body's metabolic rate, resulting in heat production that can raise the internal body temperature to approximately 40^C. Although thermoregulatory mechanisms struggle to control it, this increase is an expected effect due to high muscle energy expenditure. Healthy limits are challenged by extreme exercise."

        "Go up little",
        "Descend"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "When the body is exposed to an environment of extreme ambient cold, the thermoregulatory mechanism can be overwhelmed by the high rate of heat loss. This imbalance causes the core temperature to begin to progressively decrease, potentially falling below 35.5^C in severe cases of prolonged exposure to cold. The body fights to conserve heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What regulates body temperature for its constancy?",

        "Sweat rate",
        "Basal metabolism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The body's thermal regulation is fundamentally based on maintaining a dynamic balance between the rate of heat production, generated by metabolism, and the rate of heat loss, mainly through the skin. When production exceeds loss, temperature increases, and vice versa, keeping the body within its homeostatic limits. This balance is fundamental for life."

        "Thyroxine",
        "Shivering",
        "Adrenalin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Shivering consists of rapid, rhythmic and involuntary muscle contractions that do not generate external work, but rather convert chemical energy directly into heat. This mechanism is activated by the thermoregulatory center when it detects that the body temperature is dropping, which allows internal heat production to be increased considerably. Shivering is an instinctive conservation response."

        "Estrogen",
        "Glucagon"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Thyroxine, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, has a profound effect on cellular metabolism, increasing the basal metabolic rate of almost all cells in the body. This increase in metabolism directly translates into greater heat production. Other hormones such as growth hormone and testosterone also contribute, but to a lesser extent than thyroxine."

        "Skin and subcutaneous tissue",
        "Liver and heart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Most of the heat produced in the body originates in the internal organs with high metabolic activity, considered the 'center' of the body. Among these vital organs, the liver, brain and heart are the main contributors to heat production, apart from the skeletal muscles when engaged in intense activity. The brain, for its part, is a voracious consumer of energy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is heat transferred from deep organs to the skin?",
      "options": [
        "by breathing",
        "by blood flow",
        "For skin insulation",
        "Due to muscle contractions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The heat generated in the center of the body is mainly transported to the skin surface through blood circulation. The warm blood flowing from the internal organs acts as an efficient convection system, bringing heat to the skin, from where it can be dissipated to the environment. Blood is the main vehicle for heat transfer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What acts as the body's fundamental thermal insulator?",
      "options": [
        "Hair",
        "Sweat",
        "Skin and subcutaneous tissue",
        "Muscle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The skin, together with the subcutaneous tissues, especially the fat layer, form a highly effective thermal insulating system for the body. This system helps retain vital heat in the center of the body, preventing its rapid loss to the environment, which is essential to maintain a constant core temperature. Fat is key to calorie retention."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does fat conduct heat relative to other tissues?",
      "options": [
        "Much faster than others",
        "At a third of the speed",
        "at the same speed",
        "very slowly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The fat present in the subcutaneous tissue is an excellent insulator because it has a very low thermal conductivity. Specifically, it conducts heat at a rate that is only one-third the rate at which other body tissues conduct it. This characteristic makes it an essential protective layer against ambient cold. Without subcutaneous fat, heat loss would be greater."

        "Arteriole",
        "Vein",
        "Artery",
        "venous plexus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The continuous venous plexus is a vascular network that is located just under the skin and is the main recipient of blood that comes from the skin capillaries. This plexus is crucial because the volume of blood circulating through it determines the amount of heat that is transferred to the surface for dissipation, acting as the body's radiator. Blood flows in a controlled manner."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the maximum blood flow to the skin in vasodilation?",
      "options": [
        "10% of cardiac output",
        "50% of cardiac output",
        "30% of cardiac output",
        "1% of cardiac output"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Blood flow to the skin has the capacity to vary extremely, from virtually zero during vasoconstriction to a maximum of approximately 30% of total cardiac output. This range is essential for thermal control, allowing great efficiency in heat transfer from the center to the surface when necessary. This large volume allows for rapid dissipation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What mechanism is the most efficient to transfer heat to the skin?",
      "options": [
        "Skin blood flow",
        "Isolation",
        "Sweating",
        "Metabolism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skin blood flow, whose speed is highly adjustable, is considered the most efficient mechanism that the body has to transfer internally generated heat to the surface of the skin. By increasing flow (vasodilation), large amounts of heat are rapidly transported to the surface for subsequent loss to the environment. Without this flow there would be no effective heat loss."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does the conductance multiply with maximum vasodilation?",
      "options": [
        "Twice",
        "four times",
        "six times",
        "Eightfold"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Heat conductance, which measures how easily heat passes from the core to the skin, can increase by up to a factor of eight when the vascular system transitions from a state of full vasoconstriction to a state of full vasodilation. This enormous increase illustrates the skin's great ability to function as a highly controllable heat radiator. The body can dissipate heat very quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What nervous system controls cutaneous vasoconstriction?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic",
        "Somatic",
        "Enteric",
        "Sympathetic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system exerts almost total control over the degree of vasoconstriction of the arterioles and arteriovenous anastomoses that supply the venous plexus of the skin. This control is vital, since the sympathetic system responds to signals that indicate variations in both core temperature and environmental temperature, adjusting blood flow and, therefore, heat loss. The sympathetic system is the master of thermoregulation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process reduces heat conduction to the skin?",
      "options": [
        "Vasodilation",
        "High blood flow",
        "Vasoconstriction",
        "parasympathetic nerve"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of blood vessels that reduces the speed of blood flow to the venous plexus of the skin. By decreasing the transport of warm blood from the center, vasoconstriction minimizes the transfer and loss of heat to the skin surface, thus conserving the body's internal heat. It is a protective mechanism against cold and hypothermia."

    {
      "question": "What structure connects arteries and venous plexus in hands and feet?",
      "options": [
        "Capillaries",
        "Venules",
        "Lymphatic",
        "arteriovenous anastomoses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "In body areas such as the hands, feet and ears, small arteries have direct connections with the venous plexus through arteriovenous anastomoses, which are provided with abundant muscle tissue. These anastomoses are essential because they allow extremely rapid and efficient control of blood flow to the skin to regulate heat loss in these areas. They are essential vascular shortcuts for thermal control."

        "Cold feeling",
        "Release heat to the environment",
        "Estimate metabolism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The main physiological importance of skin temperature lies in the fact that it determines the capacity and speed at which the body can release heat into the surrounding atmosphere. The temperature difference between the skin and the external environment drives heat loss by radiation, conduction and convection, processes vital to maintaining stable core temperature. Warmer skin loses heat more efficiently."

        "The use of clothing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Clothing traps air close to the skin, increasing the thickness of the insulating layer of air. This considerably reduces the rate of heat loss by conduction to the air and by convection, thus maintaining body temperature."

        "Prostaglandin E_2",
        "acetic acid",
        "Adrenalin",
        "Serotonin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Experiments suggest that IL-1 first induces the synthesis of a prostaglandin, specifically E_2, which ultimately acts on the hypothalamus to cause the febrile reaction and increase in body temperature."

      "question": "What type of medications reduce fever?",
      "options": [
        "Local anesthetics",
        "Anti-inflammatories",
        "Antihistamines",
        "Antipyretics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "Medications that have the ability to reduce or eliminate fever, often by blocking the formation of prostaglandins such as PGE_2, are called antipyretic drugs. Acetylsalicylic acid is an example."

        "Lidocaine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Acetylsalicylic acid, commonly known as aspirin, is an antipyretic medication. Its main mechanism of action is to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid."

      "question": "What happens to body temperature if the set point increases?",
      "options": [
        "Increases inversely",
        "Decreases rapidly",
        "Increases in several hours",
        "remains constant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When the hypothalamic set point rises sharply, it takes several hours for body temperature to reach that new value. During this time, mechanisms such as vasoconstriction and shivering are activated to produce heat."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens during the chilling period?",
      "options": [
        "Profuse sweating",
        "Cutaneous vasodilation",
        "Feeling of extreme cold",
        "Abolition of shivering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "During the shivering period, the actual body temperature is lower than the new set point. This generates intense vasoconstriction and the person feels extremely cold, even though their temperature may be higher than normal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the sudden drop in the set point in fever known?",
      "options": [
        "Crisis",
        "Hyperpyrexia",
        "Acclimatization",
        "Hypoxia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'crisis' is the sudden change of events that occurs when the factor causing the fever is eliminated. The set point drops, and the body responds with intense vasodilation and sweating to cool down quickly."

        "bradycardia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Severe symptoms, such as mental confusion and loss of consciousness, are mainly due to hyperpyrexia, which is a dangerous elevation in body temperature. Neurons are especially sensitive to this heat damage."

        "The brain",
        "skeletal muscle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "When a person dies from hyperpyrexia, the pathological examination shows parenchymal degeneration and hemorrhages throughout the body, with the brain being the most affected. Destroyed neurons cannot regenerate."

        "Loss of salt in urine",
        "Aldosterone hyposecretion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "During the acclimatization process to extreme heat, an increase in plasma volume is observed, along with a doubling of the sweating rate and a reduction in salt loss, thanks to aldosterone."
