      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hypoventilation is one of the main causes of hypoxemia, since it reduces the volume of air that reaches the alveoli per unit of time, decreasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A shunt is the fraction of cardiac output that passes from the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein without passing through ventilated areas.
