      "question": "Where do the sympathetic trunks descend into the abdomen?",
      "options": [
        "Next to the rectus muscles",
        "About the spine",
        "Anterior to the peritoneum",
        "Through the inguinal canal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic trunks, after entering the abdomen, descend along the spine, adjacent to the psoas major muscles, maintaining a deep and central position in the abdomen and pelvis."

      "question": "How many lumbar ganglia are generally found in the sympathetic trunks?",
      "options": [
        "Only one or two",
        "Generally three to five",
        "six or more",
        "Only the celiac ganglia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The lumbar ganglia in the sympathetic trunks are irregular in number, position, and size, but typically range from two to six, with three to five lumbar ganglia being most commonly found in each trunk."

    {
      "question": "Which nerve is the most inferior that has preganglionic fibers?",
      "options": [
        "LI nerve",
        "LII nerve",
        "LIV nerve",
        "LV nerve"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The LII nerve is the most inferior of the spinal nerves that contains preganglionic fibers. This fact is important surgically, because sectioning the sympathetic trunk below the anastomosis with this nerve would sever the preganglionic fibers of the lower limb."

    {
      "question": "What do the superior lumbar splanchnic nerves form?",
      "options": [
        "Superior hypogastric plexus",
        "Intermesenteric plexuses",
        "sacral plexus",
        "Celiac and adjacent plexuses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 4,
      "explanation": "The superior visceral branches, formed by the lumbar splanchnic nerves, join the celiac plexuses and adjacent nerve plexuses, contributing to the sympathetic innervation of the upper abdominal viscera."

    {
      "question": "What is the large prevertebral plexus of the abdomen composed of?",
      "options": [
        "Only phrenic nerves",
        "Vagus and splanchnic nerves",
        "lumbar plexus",
        "Only blood vessels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The large prevertebral plexus of the abdomen is a dense network formed by splanchnic nerves, branches of both vagus nerves and masses of ganglion cells, all included in connective tissue, crucial for visceral autonomic innervation."

    {
      "question": "What do the sympathetic ganglia resemble in their innervation?",
      "options": [
        "medulla of the adrenal glands",
        "Kidneys",
        "Spleen",
        "thyroid gland"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The medulla of the adrenal glands are functionally similar to the sympathetic ganglia because their cells are directly innervated by preganglionic sympathetic fibers, allowing them to release catecholamines directly into the bloodstream."
